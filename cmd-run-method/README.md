# READ THIS BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING !!!

Read the following guidelines carefully.

## File Format

If you are using IDE, export the project as a .JAR file to run the program appropriately. Remember to save the jar file as:
```bash
    sll.jar
```

```bash
  Once you are done, open cmd and run the .bat file in the same directory as that of .jar file.
```
